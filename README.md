### This case study explores how dynamic user inputs can drive the execution of distinct workflow paths within an automated data process. By allowing users to select their preferred analysis route—such as filtering data by origin airport or airline—the workflow intelligently adapts in real time, enabling or disabling specific processing streams based on conditional logic. The result is a flexible, user-centric workflow that enhances efficiency, reduces unnecessary computation, and improves the overall user experience in data-driven decision-making environments.
